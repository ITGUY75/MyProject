<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>INT.CAR (NOT MOVING) - DAY</p>
<p>Empty for a few seconds. Then the door opens up.</p>
<p>RORY AGUILERA, late 20s, climbs in. Sits in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>He looks around. Checks little things here and there.</p>
<p>Then Rory adjusts the rearview mirror. He makes his seat more comfortable to sit in.</p>
<p>He grabs his keys, starts up the vehicle.</p>
<p>The seatbelt slides into place. It is ready to protect him.</p>
<p>RORY AGUILERA: You gotta work. I gotta get out of here. C'mon.</p>
<p>But nothing happens.</p>
<p>Rory tries again.</p>
<p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>Making a fist with his hand, Rory pounds the steering wheel repeatedly.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>RORY AGUILERA (O.S.) Why this?! Shit! This can't be happening to me. Not now.</p>

<p>The story is a personal drama. It meant a lot to me to write this screenplay.</p>
