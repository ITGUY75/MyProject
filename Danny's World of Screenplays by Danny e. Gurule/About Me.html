<center><b><p><h3>Welcome to my screenplay page. Here you'll learn all about me: interests and hobbies, favorite movie genres and film directors, and anything else. Someone told me a very long time ago to create a website about my writings. So here I am. I hope you enjoy the website. I will update this website whenever I can. And once again, enjoy this website.</p><b></h3></center>
<h1 style="text-align:center">Let's Get Rambling</h1>
<center><b><p><h3>(I'll try to be truthful!) I'm not gonna BS here and bore you about myself. How old I am? What I look like? What I do for a living? All I'm gonna say is I'm a screenwriter. Future film director. I'm struggling to be one right now. It is hard. But a nice person told me to put up a website and express myself and my talent. Everyone who has read something I wrote has told me they really really enjoyed my stories. Sometimes I feel like that kid in Stand by Me. Hey....let's sit by the fire and I'll tell you another story. This story is about....you know the rest. Enjoy.</p><b></h3></center>
<center><b><p><h3>(the truth hurts) my personal history: Born in 1975, the 29th of November. I lived in Roswell, New Mexico for 3 years. (Alien sightings, yes) Came to Lubbock, Texas in 1978. I really want to live in California. But they say you can write where you are at. Recently, I am thinking of moving to Las Vegas, Nevada. Who knows what the future holds? Recently, I decided on Arizona to live. I am going to check it out in October. So I will move after that. So 2005 seems like the change of Danny. I'll keep you informed.</p><b></h3></center>
<center><b><p><h3>I went to many schools here in Lubbock, Texas. High School was Coronado. Graduated in 1994. Went to College for a year and a half. I recently went back in 2012. I am still working on finally getting a degree. Sometimes I wish I should have went back when I was working at the movie theater during 1998. I started working there in 1996. I got my education in writing screenplays by watching movie commentaries and reading filmmaking and screenwriting books that I bought at the bookstore and online. I have a lot of books on filmmaking. I am excited with getting back into it slowly with more story ideas. Hopefully, I can post them up here on my website.</p><b></h3></center>
