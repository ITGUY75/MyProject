<p>A few pages in we get to know the main character and his problem.</p>
<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>INT.LIVING ROOM - DAY</p>
<p>Darrell has on some clothes. He looks at the front door twice.</p>
<p>DARRELL CHANDLER: I must get rid of the body.</p>
<p>He marches over to the WOMAN on the floor.</p>
<p>Darrell grabs her legs. Slides her body across the floor.</p>
<p>He passes by the door. Darrell peeks through the peephole on the door. He makes a strange face.</p>
<p>DARRELL CHANDLER: Oh Shit!</p>
<p>There is a pounding at the front door now. It grows louder and louder.</p>
<p>He puts his dirty clothes on the dead woman's body.</p>
<p>EXT.HOUSE-DAY</p>
<p>A person is standing by the front door. She is Darrell Chandler's Mother, ESTELLE.</p>
<p>She walks on the lawn and tries to peek through the windows.</p>
<p>ESTELLE CHANDLER: Why did I tell this kid to put up curtains?</p>
<p>[.....]</p>
<p>Things get worse for Darrell Chandler.</p>

<center><b><u><p><h2>Screenplay 2 (Suspicion, 1999)</center></b></u></p></h2>
<p>A few pages in we are into a murder.</p>
<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>INT.HOUSE-DAY</p>
<p>(renamed character--female)walks over to the counter.</p>
<p>She sees a newspaper. Lifts it up. Stares at it.</p>
<p>She looks around.</p>
<p>The attractive college gal reaches over and picks up the phone. Dials.</p>
<p>[.....]</p>
<p>I'm rewriting this one. It is supposed to be more suspenseful.</p>
<p>The story is about a girl who finds out her dad might be a murderer. But the story is more complex than that.</p>

<center><b><u><p><h2>Untitled (2002)</center></b></u></p></h2>
<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>INT.BAR-DAY</p>
<p>A man is sitting on a stool by the bar and sipping back on some hard liquor. He stares ahead.</p>
<p>MAN: It is no surprise that I do things that I'm not allowed to do. It is part of the job. I was hired to do a job and I can't upset these peope. Or myself.</p>
<p>He continues to look ahead.</p>
<p>MAN: That is why I'm sitting here drinking down my favorite hard liquor. Wishing I was doing something better with my time. But I'm not. It is noon. The lunch crowd will be here any minute to start up some shit with me. I know this.</p>
<p>The bartender comes by and refills his glass. The man nods. Takes a sip. Sets it down on the bar.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>ANOTHER MAN enters the bar but the man at the bar doesn't notice. The other guy goes to the jukebox and slides the quarter in. Pushes some buttons.</p>
<p>A ROCK TUNE blasts.</p>
<p>The other guy goes to the other side of the man and puts his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>BEHIND THE SUBURBAN</p>
<p>ROMERO: Derek!</p>
<p>Adam goes next.</p>
<p>He runs out. Starts to fire.</p>
<p>A cop fires and hits Adam's automatic weapon. The gun explodes and rips off Adam's right hand.</p>
<p>Adam stands weaponless and tries to head for the door but is taken back a few feet when the cops bombard him with bullets.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Romero begins to run out from behind the Suburban when Jeno tries to get out of the Suburban.</p>
<p>The cops hit Jeno and the bullets spin him, Romero catches Jeno before he falls and uses his body as cover until he reaches the door. Jeno's body drops at the door.</p>
<p>The cops split up, two go over to the wreck and the rest head over to the back door of the building.</p>
